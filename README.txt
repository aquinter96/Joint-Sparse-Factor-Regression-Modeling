This folder contains the R code and bash scripts used to generate data and fit models for simulation studies, construct figures and tables, and fit
the models provided in the real data application.

Alternate Simulations and Real Data Application Code: Contains the code used for fitting the JSFRM model under the alternate scenario where the covariance matrix Psi is
an arbitrary positive diagonal matrix. This includes the code used to generate Tables H4, H5, H6, H7, and I8.

Computation Speed Comparison Code: Contains the code that simulates the data used in Table J9, as well as code to generate Table J9 itself.

Figures Code: Contains the R code used to simulate the data used in the figures, as well as the code used to generate the figures.

JSFRM Functions: Contains the R functions used to fit our model.

Real Data Application Code and Data: Contains the data, R code, and bash script used to fit our model to each country and the R code used to generate the metrics for Table 3 from
said fits.

Simulations and Tables Code: Contains the R code and bash scripts used to fit our model to the simulated data under each of the 4 scenarios discussed in the paper, and the code used to
generate the metrics used in Tables 1, 2, F2, and F3.
